# AI-Virtual-Mouse
This project implements an AI-based virtual mouse that enables hands-free cursor control and click actions using hand gestures captured via a webcam. It combines computer vision and machine learning, supporting both Random Forest for fast inference and CNNs for higher accuracy and robustness.
